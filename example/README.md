Data needed for reproducing the results in the Publication <br/>
F. Pultar, JACS, 2021, submitted.
<br/>
The structure is as follows:<br/>
Directory OMEGA:<br/>
  Sampling of conformers<br/>
DFT:<br/>
  Input files and output files from the DFT calculations<br/>
IRSA scripts:<br/>
  Pickled files and scripts, which can be used to obtain the results reported in the publication<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Notice that we did not know the correct structure at this stage. Hence, the archives are named 0 (isomer epi-I in the publication) and 1 (isomer I, correct isomer).
